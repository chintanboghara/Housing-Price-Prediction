## Housing Price Prediction

## Overview

This project is a simple machine learning task that aims to predict median house prices based on median income. It uses a linear regression model for prediction and includes data preprocessing, visualization, model building, and evaluation.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **`housing.csv`**: This CSV file contains the dataset used for this project, including features like median income and median house value.

- **`housing_price_prediction.ipynb`**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the Python code for data analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and visualization.

## Data

The dataset used in this project, `housing.csv`, contains the following columns:

- `median_income`: Median income of households in a particular area.
- `median_house_value`: Median house value for houses in a particular area.
- `total_bedrooms`: Total number of bedrooms in houses in a particular area.

## Results

The project will generate various visualizations and provide the R-squared score as a measure of the model's performance.
